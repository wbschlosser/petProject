Hey!

So I did the best I could thus far. As I said I realized I forgot a lot about coding over the summer because I didn’t do it. 

I added a plain text file with the navigation information from my personal site since that is style I wanted to go for. It’s the file called initialNav.txt

Still need to get the color to span the entire page along with the images.

I’ve added the icons for the navigation. 

I’ll keep trucking along. Hopefully we can finish before thanksgiving if not by december 1st. 

As far as content I realized I have that stuff on my desktop so I can’t access it till I get home. 

Happy coding!
