Hey!

So I did the best I could thus far. As I said I realized I forgot a lot about coding over the summer because I didn’t do it. 

I added a plain text file with the navigation information from my personal site since that is style I wanted to go for. It’s the file called initialNav.txt

Still need to get the color to span the entire page along with the images.

I’ve added the icons for the navigation. 

I’ll keep trucking along. Hopefully we can finish before thanksgiving if not by december 1st. 

As far as content I realized I have that stuff on my desktop so I can’t access it till I get home. 

Happy coding!

The issue with having the images span the entire page is that they'd, potentially, be a huge resource for people on mobile networks to view. The page, for me anyways, is at least 1920x1080, and if we're going to have the images be that size mobile devices are going to have a hard time downloading an image that big, much less 4 of them. It's totally up to you.

I did make the banner background black, and all that I need left to do is work on the navigation bit. It's going to take a bit of thinking, I'll have to look at your other site to try to get it. Hopefully it doesn't require any 3rd party javascript, because I wouldn't know where to begin getting that.
