			<h2>Pitbulls and bully breeds</h2><br />
			<div>
				<p class="first">Bully breeds. This term has been given to a variety of dogs and gives them an unfair reputation for being dangerously aggressive. Pit bulls are a breed of dog that falls under this category but with the right owner and training they can be very sweet and lovable dogs. <br /> There are some myths that accompany Pit Bulls but they are untrue. One myth is that Pit Bulls have locking jaws. They have regular jaws like any other dog. Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin from the Universty of Georgia concluded after doing research that "...the American Pit Bull Terriers did not have any unique mechanism that would allow these dogs to lock their jaws. There were no mechanical or morphological differences..."</p>
				<p>Below is a list of other dogs that fall into the category of Bully Breed:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The boxer</li>

			<h2>Can pets get hiccups</h2><br />
			<div>
				<p class="first">    Yes! Just like humans dogs and cats can get hiccups.  When the muscles that control the diaphram involuntarily contract hiccups can result.  It is more commonly seen when cats or dogs eat or drink too fast.  With cats hairballs can also cause hiccups. 
     In dogs if they have frequent or persisting hiccups you may want to take them to their vet. This could be a cause of a more serious issue such as asthma, pneumonia, pericarditis, stroke or hypothermia.</p>
				<p>   In cats if they have frequent or persisting hiccups you may want to take them to their vet. This could be a cause of a more serious issue such as a tumor, organ disease, or even nerve problems. Sometimes when cats cough it can sound like hiccups but could possibly be a sign of a more dangerous problem.  Sometimes coughing is a sign something is stuck in their throat or possibly a sign of by allergies, tumors, asthma, heartworms.  This is especially true in older cats.  Hiccups could also be a sign of emtional problems such as anxiety. </p>
