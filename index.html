			<h2>Can pets get hiccups?</h2><br />
		 <p>Yes! Just like humans dogs and cats can get hiccups.  When the muscles that control the diaphram involuntarily contract hiccups can result.  It is more commonly seen when cats or dogs eat or drink too fast.  With cats hairballs can also cause hiccups. 
     In dogs if they have frequent or persisting hiccups you may want to take them to their vet. This could be a cause of a more serious issue such as asthma, pneumonia, pericarditis, stroke or hypothermia.</p>
     <p>  In cats if they have frequent or persisting hiccups you may want to take them to their vet. This could be a cause of a more serious issue such as a tumor, organ disease, or even nerve problems. Sometimes when cats cough it can sound like hiccups but could possibly be a sign of a more dangerous problem.  Sometimes coughing is a sign something is stuck in their throat or possibly a sign of by allergies, tumors, asthma, heartworms.  This is especially true in older cats.  Hiccups could also be a sign of emtional problems such as anxiety.</p>
